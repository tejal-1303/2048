# 2048
An interactive single player game implemented in C++

The goal of the game is to combine equally-valued tiles to reach the 2048 tile without getting stuck.

Various OOPs concepts were implemented to allow the user to undo their moves, allow them to restart the game, quit the game and look at the results and help whenever necessary.

File handling was also used to allow the user to view their highest scores, and they were also provided the functionality of resetting the leader board.

Attatched in the source files is a ppt explaining the workingof the project.
